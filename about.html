            <p>"The publication of “Kabyomala” in 2020 was a memorable moment, as it included some of my own poetry as well. Among them, I was deeply moved by the poems written by my younger brother, Jubair Sifat. As a Hafiz of the Qur’an, his writings reflect a deep sense of faith, heartfelt emotion, and remarkable linguistic beauty. Even at a young age, his mature thoughts and creative expression have marked him as a promising poet and artist. I pray that Allah allows him to use this divine gift to bring benefit to both society and the Ummah."</p>
